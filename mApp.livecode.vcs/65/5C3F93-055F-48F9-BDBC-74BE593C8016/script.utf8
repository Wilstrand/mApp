    -- For fixed height data grid forms you can use items 1 through 4 of pControlRect as
    -- boundaries for laying out your controls.
    -- For variable height data grid forms you can use items 1 through 3 of pControlRect as
    -- boundaries, expanding the height of your control as needed.
        
    -- Example:
    put the rect of field "name" of me into theFieldRect
    put item 3 of pControlRect - 5 into item 3 of theFieldRect
    set the rect of field "name" of me to theFieldRect
